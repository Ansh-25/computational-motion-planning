# Computational Motion Planning

### Assignment 1  
  I learned and implemented various Graph-based Planning Methods such as breadth first search or grassfire algorithm, Dijkstra’s algorithm and the A Star procedure.  
  
### Assignment 2
   I learned teh concept of configuration space and obstacles. I also explored a few approaches that can be used to discretize the continuous configuration space into graphs so that I can apply graph-based tools to solve motion planning problems.
  
### Assignment 3
  I learned and implemented sample-based path planning techniques such as Probabilistic Road Maps (PRM) and Randomly Exploring Rapid Trees (RRTs)  
  
### Assignment 4
  In this assignment I implemented another approach of motion planning involving construction of artificial potential fields which are designed to attract the robot to a desired goal configuration and repel it from configuration space obstacles. The robot’s motion is guided by considering the gradient of this potential function.
